# Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

As part of this exercise we explored data from UCI machine learning repository. 

We tried to understand profile of customers accepting coupons at following

- Bars
- Coffee House

As part of the clean up process, we filled out null values under different columns with appropriate values from other rows and also, normalized/ simplified the string values into numeric values/ categories for simpler analysis.

## Profile of customers accepting coupons at Bar

We looked at comparison of coupon acceptance between following customer attributes

1. Customer going to bar 3 or fewer vs who went more than 3.
2. Customers going to bar more than once and age over 25 vs others
3. Customers going to bar more than once and having no kid passengers vs having occupations other than farming/fishing/forestry
4. Customers going to bar more than once and age under 30 vs not widowed

Based on results, it was deduced that bar coupons are accepted mostly by passengers going to bar 3 or fewer times and are over the age of 25. These passengers belong to occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry and were neither kids or widowed.

## Profile of customers accepting coupons at Coffee House

We looked at comparison of coupon acceptance between following customer attributes

1. Customer going to coffee house 3 or fewer vs who went more than 3.
2. Customers going to coffee house more than once and age over 30 vs others
3. Customers going to coffee house more than once and traveling alone/with partner/with kids
4. Customers going to coffee house more than once and visiting coffee house during morning/afternoon or evening hours
5. Customers going to coffee house more than once and unemployed/student/employed.

Based on above observations, its observed that following customers are likely to accept coffee house coupon

- Are under the age of 30
- Are neither students or unemployed
